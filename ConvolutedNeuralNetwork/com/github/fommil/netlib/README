This folder contains the netlib reference implementations.

The netlib API is a Fortran API. The recommended C interface is via
the CBLAS wrapper (for BLAS) and the LAPACKE wrapper (for LAPACK).

netlib-java uses the C interface for native calls.

Note that the CLAPACK effort is a translation of the Fortran codes into C
and is therefore not as performant as the original Fortran codes - we
do not use CLAPACK.

There is no official C interface to ARPACK:
[ARPACK-1287](http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/arpack-ng/issues/1287/).

Complex and double complex routines are not included because they are not
supported by netlib-java.

The following files have been removed because they don't compile:

BLAS/xerbla.c
LAPACK/xerbla.f
LAPACK/*_extended.f
LAPACK/{d,s}{gb,ge,po,sy}{rfs,svx}x.f
LAPACKE/lapacke_{d,s}{gb,ge,po,sy}{rfs,svx}x{_work,}.c


LAPACK ships with a bundled version of BLAS, but we use the original BLAS.
Likewise for ARPACK and BLAS/LAPACK.
